        authorName : "VAAMANAA SETHI",
        blogContent : `Demand for property could take a hit this festive season, as India’s central bank has hiked interest rates by another 50 basis points. Rising inflation and steady increase in interest rates have made the cost of acquisition of real estate more expensive.
        The Reserve Bank of India has hiked interest rates by 190 basis points in the last five months, which substantially increased borrowing costs for home buyers.
        Developers are of the view that demand for property could be hit in the ongoing festive season as buyer sentiment could take a hit. Anarock’s recent consumer sentiment survey also highlighted that at least 61% people saw high inflation as a major concern which is seriously impacting their disposable incomes.
        “With this repo rate hike, home loans will get dearer soon. This could impact residential sales to some extent during the upcoming festive quarter, particularly in the affordable and mid-range housing segments,” said Anuj Puri, chairman at Anarock group.`

        Air pollution can amplify the negative effects of climate change, and in some cases, pollution co-emitted with CO2 can increase the social cost of carbon by as much as 66 per cent, a new study co-led by an Indian-origin researcher has revealed.

        It is the first such study to simulate how aerosol pollution affects both climate and air quality in locations around the globe.
        Aerosols are tiny solid particles and liquid droplets that contribute to smog and are emitted from industrial factories.
        The researchers, led by The University of Texas at Austin and the University of California San Diego in the US, found that, depending on where they are emitted, aerosols can worsen the social costs of carbon - an estimate of the economic costs of greenhouse gasses have on society - by as much as 66 per cent.
        The scientists looked at eight key regions: Brazil, China, East Africa, Western Europe, India, Indonesia, the US and South Africa.
        The findings showed that some emerging economies, like East African nations and India, might be motivated to collaborate on emission cuts since each other's emissions strongly impact them.
        "Carbon dioxide has the same impact on climate no matter which emits it," said co-lead author Geeta Persad, assistant professor at the UT Austin Jackson School of Geosciences.
        But for, these aerosol pollutants tend to stay concentrated near where they're emitted, "so the effect that they have on the climate system is very patchy and very dependent on where they're coming from," she noted in the study published in the journal Science Advances.
        Aerosols can directly affect human health and the climate independently of CO2.
        "CO2 is making the planet warmer, but it also gets emitted with a bunch of other compounds that impact people and plants directly and cause climate changes in their own right," said Jennifer Burney, co-lead author from the UC San Diego School of Global Policy and Strategy.
